# Appointment App (back end)


## About

In this application, I have an appointment app for a Psychologist's office. The user can choose from a list of 
doctors and choose a date and time to make an appointment with the Psychologist at that time.

To build this application we used:

- Ruby on Rails;
- Active Storage;
- Postgresql database;
- Json Web Token (jwt);
- (bcrypt) to crypt password;
- Rspec to test the project;
- Linters ( Rubocop )
